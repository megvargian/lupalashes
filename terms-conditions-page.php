                            <p><strong>Patch Testing:</strong> Customers should perform a patch test before using lash adhesives. This is essential for identifying any potential allergic reactions before full application.</p>
                            <p><strong>Liability:</strong> We are not responsible for allergic reactions or injuries resulting from improper application of our products. Please follow all application instructions carefully.</p>

                            <p><strong>No Returns Policy:</strong> For hygiene reasons, lashes cannot be returned once the packaging is opened or the seal is broken. This policy helps maintain the highest standards of cleanliness for all our customers.</p>
                            <p><strong>Damage Claims:</strong> Customers have 24 hours after delivery to report damaged or "shedding" lashes with photographic proof. Claims must be submitted within this timeframe for consideration.</p>
                            <p><strong>Color Variations:</strong> Please note that screen settings can affect how the lash color looks in photos versus in person. We recommend checking product descriptions and reviews for accurate color representation.</p>
